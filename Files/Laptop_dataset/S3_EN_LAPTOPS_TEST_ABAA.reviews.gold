I liked the aluminum body.
Lightweight and the screen is beautiful!
From the build quality to the performance, everything about it has been sub-par from what I would have expected from Apple.

It was truly a great computer costing less than one thousand bucks before tax.
Boots up fast and runs great!

Call tech support, standard email the form and fax it back in to us.
The service I received from Toshiba went above and beyond the call of duty.
I would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about.
The screen shows great colors.
The battery life has not decreased since I bought it, so i'm thrilled with that.
The price and features more than met my needs.

the mouse buttons are hard to push.
This is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design.
The technical service for dell is so 3rd world it might as well not even bother.
The built in camera is very useful when chatting with other techs in remote buildings on our campus.
Keyboard good sized and wasy to use.
Great wifi too.
Games being the main issue.
The price is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop.
But see the macbook pro is different because it may have a huge price tag but it comes with the full software that you would actually need and most of it has free future updates.

It's a great product for a great price!
Excellent speed for processing data.
The Macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box, all the functions works great.

The switchable graphic card is pretty sweet when you want gaming on the laptop.

I would like at least a 4 hr. battery life.
It has good speed and plenty of hard drive space.

The driver updates don't fix the issue, very frustrating.
Im glad that it has such great features in it.
I always have used a tower home PC and jumped to the laptop and have been very satisfied with its performance.
My sister has the same Mac as me and she is in a band and uses GarageBand to record and edit.
and looks very sexyy:D really the mac book pro is the best laptop specially for students in college if you are not caring about price.
Also, the extended warranty was a problem.
My opinion of Sony has been dropping as fast as the stock market, given their horrible support, but this machine just caused another plunge.
I also liked the glass screen.
When I called Toshiba, they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $35 for the phone call, even though they didn't offer any technical support.
(Beware, their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a computer is.
The only thing that I don't like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that I want to be able to run and I am not able to.
Wireless has not been a issue for me, like some others have meantioned.
MacBook Notebooks quickly die out because of their short battery life, as well as the many background programs that run without the user's knowlede.

All for such a great price.
